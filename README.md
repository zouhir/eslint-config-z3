The Great ESLint Rules of Zouhir

</h1>

Because it is very important to make code more readable, especially shitty one.

âœ… Those are personal lint configs.

âœ… 100% of people surveyed actually loved those rules, even Maroush's 2 years old baby boy likes them very much.

âœ… Based on JS Very Standard Style.

âœ… With `;` but they still Standard.

ðŸ’£ Don't call them semi-standard, I know you want to smartass.

âœ… Use ONLY for peaceful programs.
